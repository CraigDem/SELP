Will there be any marks lost for running functions primarily by loading a new page for every user action vs updating information asynchronously? Or is it left as a design decision?

My game will use time constraints to limit some purchases to once a day/week/month. Is it okay for me to include a script which will reset those timers to make it far easier to test?
